# Introduction
This is a personal project whereby I conducted research on student entrepreneurs in Nigerian Universities and their usage of WhatsApp as a medium/tool for marketing their products and services. The need for this research study was as a result of the surge in students venturing into entrepreneurship on campuses in Nigeria due to increase in tuition fees.
# Business Task
Evaluate the effectiveness of WhatsApp as a marketing tool for student entrepreneurs.
# Data Source
I personally obtained data from undergraduate students of Benson Idahosa University in Benin City, Nigeria. A survey was carried out through the distribution of questionnaires with which answers were provided anonymously in order to ensure privacy protection. 
# Methods
* The populaton was too large to cover so a representative sample derived through the purposive random sampling technique was used to determine the respondents

* Sorted and ensured that the data was in a consistent format
* Converted it to a csv file and loaded it into Tableau for visualization
