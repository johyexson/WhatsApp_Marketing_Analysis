# Project Overview
This is a personal project whereby I conducted research on student entrepreneurs in Nigerian Universities and their usage of WhatsApp as a medium/tool for marketing their products and services. The need for this research study was as a result of the surge in students venturing into entrepreneurship on campuses in Nigeria due to increase in tuition fees.
# Problem Statement
How can one ascertain the effectiveness of WhatsApp as a marketing tool for student entrepreneurs?
# Data Source
I personally obtained data from undergraduate students of Benson Idahosa University in Benin City, Nigeria. A survey was carried out through the distribution of questionnaires with which answers were provided anonymously in order to ensure privacy protection. 
# Method of Analysis
* The populaton was too large to cover so a representative sample derived through the purposive random sampling technique was used to determine the respondents
* Questionnaires were distributed to students using a person to person approach
* The data gotten from the respondents were inputed into a table in Excel
* Sorted and ensured that the data was in a consistent format
* Cleaned and transformed the data for the purpose of analysis
* Converted it to a csv file and imported it into Tableau for visualization
# Tools
* Excel
